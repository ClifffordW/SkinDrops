To show drops in your OBS.

Add > Browser 
in OBS

Copy and Paste text from drops.css into the Custom CSS box

Check Local File

Load in the corresponding drop from Drops folder that you downloaded





Alternatively you can load the css file instead of putting the code into custom css box.
To do that simply go to the desired .css file then Control + C

and into the CSS custom box type following

@import "pastehere"
